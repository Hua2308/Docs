* Computer can only save 0 and 1 digit. To be able to compute/store/transfer information, we need a encoding and decoding system to convert symbol into numbers, and vice versa. E.g. A -> 0000 0001. 
* Byte vs character:
  * Byte is 8 bits, which can be represented in the number range of 0 - 255. Byte is raw data that computer can process but is meaningless for human.
  * Character is human readable format. To convert bytes into character, we need to use encoding. Common encoding includes UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, meaning 1 bytes(8 bits) to 1 character, 2 bytes(16 bits) to 1 character, 4 bytes(32 bits) to 1 character.
