* PCR primer(引物) should be between 18 and 30 bases. Primer is short oligonucleotides.
* oligonucleotide(寡核苷酸): short DNA/RNA molecules. Oligo can readily bind its respctive complementary oligonucleotide, to form duplexes. This property is servered as the foundation to use oligo as the probe to detect DNA/RNA.
* PCR primer optimal melting temperature is 60 - 64 C, annealing temperature is <5 C below melting temp.
* GC content/ratio: the percentage of G-C pairs over GC + AT pairs total. G-C pair has triple bond(化学键), while A-T pair only has two bonds. So G-C pair is stronger and harbors more energy.
* Polymerase(聚合酶): polymerase is an enzyme that synthesizes long chains of polymers or nucleic acids.
* Polymerase chain reaction(PCR) 聚合酶链式反应 : a widely used method to make several copies of a specific DNA segment. It can be thousands to millions of more copies. This can be useful in detecting/lightning a specific DNA segment in a sample. This method relies on thermal cycling, heating and cooling cycles to permit different temperature dependent reactions, specifically DNA melting and enzyme-driven DNA replication.
* PCR steps:
  * 1. DNA melting(DNA融化): two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature. (注：亦即DNA双螺旋的断链)
    2. The temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of DNA. The two DNA strands then become templates for DNA polymerase to enzymatically assemble a new DNA strand fro free nucleotides(核苷酸).
    3. Then, the newly generated DNA becomes the templates for replication, triggering a chain reaction and amplifies DNA segment exponentially. A reaction set for 30 cycles results in 2<sup>30</sup> = 1073741824 copies.
* amplicon: the piece of DNA or RNA that is the source to amplify/replicate. It includes forward primer, reverse primer, target sequence, and tag, adaptor.
* Taq polymerase: DNA polymerase that is heat-stable which can survive every heat/cool cycle so polymerase does not need to be added in very cycle.
* Hybridization probe/DNA probe: a fragment of DNA or RNA, usually 100 - 10000 bases long, which can be radioactively or fluorescently labeled.

* Assay contains: primer, free nucleocides, polymerase
