1. Default repository location(for jar generated by 'mvn install'): 
     * `~/.m2/repository`

2. Default setting.xml location(settings.xml is usually part of the project and needs to be moved to below locations):
     * Global `~/maven_installation_dir/conf/setting.xml`
     * Local(per user) `~/.m2/setting.xml`
     * Note: local setting always overwrites global settings
