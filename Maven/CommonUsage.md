1. Default repository location(for jar generated by 'mvn install'): 
     * `~/.m2/repository`

2. Default setting.xml location(settings.xml is usually part of the project and needs to be moved to below locations):
     * Global `~/maven_installation_dir/conf/setting.xml`
     * Local(per user) `~/.m2/setting.xml`
     * Note: local setting always overwrites global settings
 
3. Install custom library into Maven local repository ([Reference](https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-include-library-manully-into-maven-local-repository/))
     * ``` mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path_to_jar_file> -DgroupId=<groupId> -DartifactId=<ArtifactId> -Dversion={version} -Dpackaging=jar ```

4. Compile or package(compile+package) source ([Reference](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/#_build_java_code))
     * compile ``` mvn compile ```
       * This will run Maven, telling it to execute the compile goal. When itâ€™s finished, you should find the compiled .class files in the target/classes directory.
     * package ``` mvn package ```
       * The package goal will compile your Java code, run any tests, and finish by packaging the code up in a JAR file within the target directory.
