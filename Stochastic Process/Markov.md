- **Stochastic process**: a.k.a random process, is a mathmatical object defined as a family of random variables. One example is **Markov process**, such as Brownian Motion.
- **Markov chain:** is a stochastic model describing a **sequence of possible events** in which the probability of each event depends **only** on the state attained in the previous event, which is also called **Markov property** or **memorylessness**.
- Any process that has Markov property is a Markov process.
- Markov process can be in continous time or discrete time.
- Non Markov example: given 5 quarter, 5 dime, 5 nickel in a purse. If X<sub>6</sub> = 0.5, i.e. withdraw 6 times and total added value is 0.5, and if we know previous withdrawing result, then we can guess it is 5 dimes had been taken out. So the possibility for dime will be 0. So X<sub>7</sub> will be impacted by the **knowledge** of values prior to X<sub>6</sub>.
